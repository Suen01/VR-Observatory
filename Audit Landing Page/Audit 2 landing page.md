# Audit Landing Page *VR-Observatory*

### CLIENT VISION
>The Giant Magellan Telescope will be one member of the next class of giant ground-based telescopes. It will be constructed in the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Commissioning of the telescope is scheduled to begin in 2024.

Our goal is to recreate the observatory in a Virtual Reality world. This software allows users to experience the observatory with a VR headset before the completion of the construction of the GMT. It can be used not only for promotion purpose but also as a tool to validate the design.

### TECHNICAL ARTEFACTS


### KEY STAKEHOLDERS
#### Dr Tony Travouillon
Tony is the director of our project and represents the interest of RSAA. He provides valuable inputs to our team, such as reqirements and some technical solutions. He also helps the team by coordinating resources and managing the communication of important personals. Meetings in person between the team and Tony are planned fortnightly. He will eventually takes control of the project after completion or at the end of the semester.

#### Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics (RSAA)
RSAA owns our project. They provides us the places and the computers that we need to work on this project. After the completion of the project, they will give it to GMTO as the contribution of RSAA.

#### GMTO Corporation
GMTO Corporation is in charge of the construction and the operation of the actual Giant Magellan Telescope in the real world. They provides us highly accurated 3D models of the telescope.

#### Users
Users are the people who use our product to experience the GMT with a VR headset.

### PROJECT OUTPUT (SINCE WEEK 3)
1. Converted part of the models into Unity.
2. Added a door-open animation to the model.
3. Found the other assets for the external environment. (Grass, tree) (need to be improved)
4. Used a demo to test the LOD group.
