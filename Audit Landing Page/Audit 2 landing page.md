# Audit Landing Page *VR-Observatory*

### CLIENT VISION
>The Giant Magellan Telescope will be one member of the next class of giant ground-based telescopes. It will be constructed in the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Commissioning of the telescope is scheduled to begin in 2024.

Our goal is to recreate the observatory in a Virtual Reality world. This software allows users to experience the observatory with a VR headset before the completion of the construction of the GMT. It can be used not only for promotion purpose but also as a tool to validate the design.
