### TEAM EXPECTATIONS


### CLIENT EXPECTATIONS
This project is about building a VR video game. Tony and GMTO expect us to perform following tasks:
* Simplify models, check geometry
* Add materials, textures, reflection, colours
* Animate the telescope (tilt, rotation, open/close shutters)
* Impelemente a flying mode with collision disabled
* Impelemente a walking mode with proper collision

They also prefer to have following features:
* Outdoor Scenery
* Lasers during nighttime
* Cars and trucks parked for scale
* People for scale
* Mirror Cell assembly mode
* Backgourd sounds
* Tour with narration

### DELIVERING VALUE
#### For Tony and RSAA
The final product of this project will be counted as the contribution of RSAA. Since GMTO will assess the contributions of each parties (RSAA is one of them) and will split the usage of the GMT to each parties according to their contributions, the product can potentially gain valuable advantage for Australian astronomers. RSAA may also use the product as a way to promote themselves.

#### For GMTO
GMTO is likely to showcase the product to politicians who might support them, potential donor, and anyone who might be interested in GMT as a method to promote themselves. They might also use the product as a way to validate their design of GMT, such as the process of evacuation under emergency situation and logistics in general.

#### For Users
Users can explore GMT will ahead of the completion of the acutal telescope.

### DELIVERABLES

### PROJECT OUTPUT (WEEK 4)
1. Converted part of the models into Unity.
2. Added a door-open animation to the model.
3. Found the other assets for the external environment. (Grass, tree) (need to be improved)
4. Used a demo to test the LOD group.

### PROJECT MILESTONE
Week | Goal
--- | --- 
4 | Conversion of models from .SLDPRT format
6 | Establishment of Unity Scene
7 | Movement
8 | Animation of the telescope
10 | Completion of Texturing
11 | Optimizing performance
12 | Finalizing

### CONSTRAINTS
* The team is inexperienced with VR video game design
* There's only one computer that has the license of Solidworks

### RISKS
* Not able to meet the performance requirment at the end
* Leaking the sensitive 3D models to the outsiders

### COSTS
* Solidworks license fee - paid by Tony
* Transportation - paid by team members if it's not free

### CONTACT
* We also use Google Drive to host our files
* This Repository won't be made publicly available because of the copyright issues
