# Audit Landing Page *VR-Observatory*

### CLIENT VISION
>The Giant Magellan Telescope will be one member of the next class of giant ground-based telescopes. It will be constructed in the Las Campanas Observatory in Chile. Commissioning of the telescope is scheduled to begin in 2024.

Our goal is to recreate the observatory in a Virtual Reality world. This software allows users to experience the observatory with a VR headset before the completion of the construction of the GMT. It can be used not only for promotion purpose but also as a tool to validate the design.

### KEY STAKEHOLDERS
#### Dr Tony Travouillon
Tony is the director of our project and represents the interest of RSAA. He provides valuable inputs to our team, such as reqirements and some technical solutions. He also helps the team by coordinating resources and managing the communication of important personals. Meetings in person between the team and Tony are planned fortnightly. He will eventually takes control of the project after completion or at the end of the semester.

#### Research School of Astronomy & Astrophysics (RSAA)
RSAA owns our project. They provides us the places and the computers that we need to work on this project. After the completion of the project, they will give it to GMTO as the contribution of RSAA.

#### GMTO Corporation
GMTO Corporation is in charge of the construction and the operation of the actual Giant Magellan Telescope in the real world. They provides us highly accurated 3D models of the telescope.

#### Users
Users are the people who use our product to experience the GMT with a VR headset.

### TEAM EXPECTATIONS


### CLIENT EXPECTATIONS
This project is about building a VR video game. Tony and GMTO expect us to perform following tasks:
* Simplify models, check geometry
* Add materials, textures, reflection, colours
* Animate the telescope (tilt, rotation, open/close shutters)
* Impelemente a flying mode with collision disabled
* Impelemente a walking mode with proper collision

They also prefer to have following features:
* Outdoor Scenery
* Lasers during nighttime
* Cars and trucks parked for scale
* People for scale
* Mirror Cell assembly mode
* Backgourd sounds
* Tour with narration

### DELIVERING VALUE
#### For Tony and RSAA
The final product of this project will be counted as the contribution of RSAA. Since GMTO will assess the contributions of each parties (RSAA is one of them) and will split the usage of the GMT to each parties according to their contributions, the product can potentially gain valuable advantage for Australian astronomers. RSAA may also use the product as a way to promote themselves.

#### For GMTO
GMTO is likely to showcase the product to politicians who might support them, potential donor, and anyone who might be interested in GMT as a method to promote themselves. They might also use the product as a way to validate their design of GMT, such as the process of evacuation under emergency situation and logistics in general.

#### For Users
Users can explore GMT will ahead of the completion of the acutal telescope.

### DELIVERABLES

### PROJECT OUTPUT (WEEK 4)
1. Converted part of the models into Unity.
2. Added a door-open animation to the model.
3. Found the other assets for the external environment. (Grass, tree) (need to be improved)
4. Used a demo to test the LOD group.

### TEAM WORK

### COMMUNICATION

### PROJECT MILESTONE
Week | Goal
--- | --- 
4 | Conversion of models from .SLDPRT format
6 | Establishment of Unity Scene
7 | Movement
8 | Animation of the telescope
10 | Completion of Texturing
11 | Optimizing performance
12 | Finalizing

### CONSTRAINTS
* The team is inexperienced with VR video game design
* There's only one computer that has the license of Solidworks

### RISKS
* Not able to meet the performance requirment at the end
* Leaking the sensitive 3D models to the outsiders

### COSTS
* Solidworks license fee - paid by Tony
* Transportation - paid by team members if it's not free

### CONTACT
* We also use Google Drive to host our files
* This Repository won't be made publicly available because of the copyright issues
